# Overview

Welcome to the Project Requirements Checklists repository! 

This repository houses a set of standardized checklists designed to bridge the gap between the buyer 
and the seller during the project initiation phase. 
These checklists ensure that all critical requirements are reviewed, discussed, and agreed upon before work begins.
